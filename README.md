# recipe-app-api

An app that I have followed from a tutorial on Udemy ( https://www.udemy.com/course/django-python-advanced/ ) to learn how to use Django, Django Rest Framework, Docker.

The app is about listing, storing, and filtering, recipies and images a user uploads.

This app is only the API Frame work. No front end is made for it.
